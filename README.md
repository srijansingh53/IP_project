## Installation
Clone and install the dependencies for the project.
```
git clone https://github.com/srijansingh53/IP_project.git
cd IP_project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The Dataset is taken from [MIAS (Mammographic Image Analysis Society) Mammography Mini-Dataset](http://peipa.essex.ac.uk/info/mias.html) and divided into two classes [normal](https://github.com/srijansingh53/IP_project/tree/master/dataset/normal) and [circ-calc](https://github.com/srijansingh53/IP_project/tree/master/dataset/circ-calc)

## Scripts

The module contains different python programs that are interdependent for use in the project

- ### [main.ipynb](https://github.com/srijansingh53/IP_project/tree/master/main.ipynb) : A jupyter notebook that contains all the steps and visualization of the algorithm

- ### [main.py](https://github.com/srijansingh53/IP_project/tree/master/main.py) : It is the driving python script which import steps of the algorithm

- ### [steps.py](https://github.com/srijansingh53/IP_project/tree/master/steps.py) : It is a class based script which function code of the algorithm step-wise

- ### [compare.py](https://github.com/srijansingh53/IP_project/tree/master/compare.py) : It compares the proposed algorithm with some prevalent IP enhancement techniques like Histogram Equalization and CLAHE

## Results
The goal of the project is to enhance the breast mammographic images so as to ease the detection of micro-calcifications or granular masses that may be malignant.

### First Step
The film-artifacts were removed using a 5x5 averaging kernel and then taking the difference between the original and mean image thresholded over a value.

### Second Step
The gradient images using both horizontal and vertical sobel operators were calculated.

### Third Step
The adaptive signal gain is calculated for each gradient images and the multiplied to it and then added to the filtered image.

### Compared Results
The results were compared with existing engancement techniques like histogram equalization and CLAHE.
